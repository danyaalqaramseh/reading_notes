# Functions in programming 

_A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing_


Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements

How can you create a Function ?  

## Declaring a Function  :


You can declare a function by providing its return value, name, and the types for its arguments. The names of the arguments are optional.


FUNCTION + FUNCTIION-NAME(){
STATEMENT ;

}
__*This function is basic and contain one statement , its shows  how to write a function*__ .

__*We can put in information inside the function to perform the task the we need to submitt , for example:*__

function getarea(width , height){

return = width*height ;

}



 
## CALLING A FUNCTION :


We say that a program or a section of code “calls” a function. This means that we want to execute the code in the function. A function may “return” a value. This means that the calling statement will receive some result from the function when the function execution is complete. This can be numbers , string ,  etc..

**how to call function with information?**

**related to the example above** if we call **"getarea (5,3)"** 5 will be used to widh and 3 will be used to height and return the value that will be 15 . 

 

 # LINKS in HTML
+ Links are created using the <a> element.
+ The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
+ If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
+ You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
+ You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to
